# Wine Classification System with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Overview

This project implements a wine classification system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The system utilizes the pandas library for dataset processing, performs data preprocessing, and employs feature scaling techniques to enhance the model's accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized in this project can be found on: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruthgn/wine-quality-data-set-red-white-wine


## Usage
- Ensure the dataset is available in the data/ directory.

- Run the WineClassifier.py script.

- The system will execute the KNN algorithm, perform data preprocessing, and display the accuracy achieved.


## Result
The wine classification system achieved an average accuracy of 93.34% on the provided dataset.
